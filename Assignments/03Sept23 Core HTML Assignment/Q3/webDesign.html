    <br />
    <p>
      Web design is the process of creating and arranging the visual elements of
      a website, including layout, color scheme, graphics, and typography. It
      involves both the aesthetic aspects and the functionality of a website,
      aiming to provide an optimal user experience. Web designers use various
      tools and technologies to design and structure websites, ensuring they are
      visually appealing, easy to navigate, and meet the needs of the target
      audience. Key considerations in web design include user interface (UI)
      design, user experience (UX) design, and responsiveness across different
      devices and screen sizes.
