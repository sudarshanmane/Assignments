    <div>About Web Development:</div>
    <br />
    <p>
      Web development involves building and maintaining websites or web
      applications. Front-end development focuses on user interface and
      interactivity using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Back-end development
      manages server-side logic and databases with languages like Node.js or
      PHP. Full-stack development combines both. Frameworks like React and
      Express.js streamline development, while responsive design ensures
      compatibility across devices. Version control (e.g., Git), web security,
      APIs, hosting, and performance optimization are crucial elements. Web
      development is dynamic, requiring developers to stay updated on evolving
      technologies.
