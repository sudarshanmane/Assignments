      document is a written, drawn, presented, or memorialized representation of
      thought, often the manifestation of non-fictional, as well as fictional,
      content. The word originates from the Latin Documentum, which denotes a
      "teaching" or "lesson": the verb doce≈ç denotes "to teach". In the past,
      the word was usually used to denote written proof useful as evidence of a
      truth or fact. In the Computer Age, "document" usually denotes a primarily
      textual computer file, including its structure and format, e.g. fonts,
      colors, and images.

      The concept of "document" has been defined by Suzanne Briet as "any
      concrete or symbolic indication, preserved or recorded, for reconstructing
      or for proving a phenomenon, whether physical or mental."[1]
