Q4)  Writ: a short not: on Tag and :l:m:nt with an :xampl:$

Ans --> 
1. In HTML a tag is a keyword which is enclosed between angle brackets ( <img> ) that indicates the start or end of the html element.
   Elements are the building blocks of the HTML documents and defines the structure and content of a webpage.

   Examples: 
   1. <p></p> tag for the paragraph
   2. <img></img> tag for representing an image
   3. <h1> tag to represent a heading
   
   an element can have the attributes in other words properties which defines the additional information related to the elements.
   consider example of an image :
   <img src="image src" width="100px"></img>
   here the src and the width both are the attributes of the img tag.
